My project is a scheduling App for the Clay County Public Library's Community Room. My goal is to schedule weekend events Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays with the App. There is a charge of $75 dollars for these events. I plan on using the Google calendar API.
At project due date time I would like to have a fuctioning App I can use to schedule people that want to use the room on weekends and send them an automated reminder about their event. If I have time I would also like to add the scheduling of 2 hour time blocks Mondays through Thursday for civic meetings at no charge. I would like to keep improving the App after the project is turned in. I would  eventually like to have the public use the App to schedule their own parties and pay at time of scheduling.
